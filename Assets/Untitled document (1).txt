They’re on holiday in the next town over, and it’s been a while since I’ve seen them last."{3}"I see.  It sounds like you’re quite fond of them.  I also have not seen my family in a long time."{2}"Family is important.  You ought to send a letter once in a while!"{3}"Perhaps. But we will meet in due time.  We always do."{2}"When we reach the port you should give them a call, I’m sure they’d be mighty happy to hear from you."{3}"..."{3}"It is a nice night, is it not?"{2}"I suppose so. Although it is awfully quiet."{3}"Really? I find that I’m partial to nights like these.  It’s much easier to listen to the stars."{2}"A poet, I see."{3}"It’s alright if you can’t hear them. Most people can’t, to my knowledge."{3}A shame, really… but that’s neither here nor there."
